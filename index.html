        <p>
            Maximus is a close-knit community of philomaths, allured by the paradoxes of mathematics. Since its founding in 2015, Maximus has taken a profusion of initiatives to bestir the inquisitiveness for maths among the students of our college. One such initiative is conducting 'Engineering Mathematics' and 'Programming in C' classes for the first-year students of our college. With the 'Maths Week' being the highlight of our mettle, we conduct events like workshops, hackathons, and several other contests throughout the year to explore the bounds of mathematics
